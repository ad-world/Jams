## Music Sessions Reimagined (Jams)

I didn't like how I built the first iteration of this application (similar stack, but uses server side templating instead of React), and I also didn't like how it was written in JavaScript instead of TypeScript, so this application addresses those concerns.

It is built fully in TypeScript and Next.js

This application is basically Spotify Sessions (was originally created before Sessions was a thing) but only one person needs spotify access. The rest of the users join the session and request songs, that the host (the spotify user) must accept before they are put into the playback queue.

This is a very bare-bones README that I will update as I continue to work on this application. I'm trying to make it as enterprise-grade and robust as possible, so while the first iteration took me about a month, I expect this one to take a little longer as I'm thinking about a lot more things while building.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
